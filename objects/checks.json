  "description": "The Check object defines a specific, testable compliance verification point that evaluates a resource against a standard, framework, or custom requirement. Checks can exist independently or may be grouped to fully assess a broader security control. While checks are typically associated with formal standards (like CIS, NIST, or ISO), they can also represent custom or organizational requirements. When mapped to controls, checks can evaluate specific control_parameters to determine compliance status, but neither the control mapping nor control_parameters are required for a valid check.",
